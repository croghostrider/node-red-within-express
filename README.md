# node-red-within-express #

This repository contains an HTTP server based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) with an embedded [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) instance.

Its intended purpose is to provide a very easily maintainable server for development and test of web and REST service prototypes.

## Features ##

The implemented server offers the following features:

* **HTTPS with optional HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirection**<br>the main server handles HTTPS only as it becomes more and more difficult to serve HTTP-only content (even locally). If desired, an additional auxiliary HTTP server may be started which redirects incoming requests to its HTTPS counterpart
* **Proxy Support**<br>if desired, the server also works behind proxies
* **Support for "self-signed" or "Let's Encrypt" Certificates**<br>for local tests, it may be sufficient to generate self-signed certificates (instructions can be found below). For public tests, the server also supports certificates generated by ["Let's Encrypt"](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* **Support for "virtual Hosts" and Subdomains**<br>the server may optionally support "virtual hosts" and, thus, serve multiple domains (including subdomains) simultaneously. If configured, all these domains will be mapped to individual subtrees on the file system effectively isolating the domains from each other
* **"www" Subdomains**<br>if desired, "www" subdomains will be mapped to their original domain (since they usually serve the same content anyway)
* **embedded Node-RED runtime**
  * incoming requests will first be compared to the entry points given by "HTTP in" nodes - and their flows be executed whenever the URL paths match (if "virtual hosts" are to be respected, all these entry points become domain-specific and must therefore be prefixed by the domain they belong to)
  * requests not matching any "HTTP in" node entry points will then be used to serve static files from the file system (or generate a 404 response if no matching file could be found)
* **embedded Node-RED editor**<br>the embedded Node-RED editor is protected by "basic HTTP authentication": initially, the server comes with a "User Registry" containing a single user (called "node-red" with the initial password "t0pS3cr3t!") who is the only one allowed to access the Node-RED editor
* **User Registry with PBKDF2 hashed Passwords and Role Support**<br>the list of registered users is stored in a JSON file with passwords saved as PBKDF2 hashes with random salt. While the server itself does not contain any user management, it may easily be added as a Node-RED flow - but, in fact, a simple text editor is sufficient to add new users, change existing ones or remove obsolete users
* **Path-specific CORS**<br>"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" may be configured for complete sites as a whole or for specific resource paths at any desired granularity
* **configurable "Content Security Policies"**<br>the server is secured using [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) with a configuration option for specific "Content Security Policies"
* **standard-compliant Logging**<br>access logging is done using [morgan](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html) and may be written into a file either in "standard Apache common log format" or as configured
