# node-red-within-express #

This repository contains an HTTP server based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) including an embedded [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) instance.

Its intended purpose is to provide a very easily maintainable server for development and test of web and REST service prototypes.

## Features ##

The implemented server has the following features:

* **HTTPS with optional HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirection**<br>the main server handles HTTPS only as it is becoming increasingly difficult to deliver pure HTTP content to browsers (even locally). If desired, an additional auxiliary HTTP server may be started which redirects incoming requests to its HTTPS counterpart
* **Proxy Support**
* **Support for "self-signed" or "Let's Encrypt" Certificates**<br>for local tests, it may be sufficient to generate self-signed certificates (instructions can be found below). For public tests, the server also supports certificates generated by ["Let's Encrypt"](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* **Support for "virtual Hosts" and Subdomains**<br>the server may optionally support "virtual hosts" and serve multiple domains (including subdomains) simultaneously. In this case, each domain will be mapped to an individual subtree on the file system in order to isolate the domains from each other
* **"www" Subdomains**<br>if desired, "www" subdomains can be mapped to their original domain (since they usually serve the same content anyway)
* **embedded Node-RED runtime**<br>incoming requests will first be compared to the entry points given by "HTTP in" nodes - and their flows be executed whenever the URL paths match (if "virtual hosts" are to be respected, all these entry points become domain-specific and their paths must therefore be prefixed by the domain they belong to). Requests not matching any "HTTP in" node entry points will then be used to serve static files from the file system (or generate a 404 response if no matching file could be found)
* **embedded Node-RED editor**<br>the embedded Node-RED editor is generally protected by "basic HTTP authentication": for that purpose, the server always comes with a "User Registry" which already contains a single user (named "node-red" with the initial password "t0pS3cr3t!") who is allowed to access the Node-RED editor
* **User Registry with PBKDF2 hashed Passwords and Role Support**<br>the list of registered users is stored in a JSON file with passwords saved as PBKDF2 hashes with random salt. While the server itself does not contain any user management, such a feature may easily be added as a Node-RED flow - although, in fact, a simple text editor is already sufficient to add new users, change existing ones or remove obsolete users
* **Path-specific CORS**<br>"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" may be configured for complete sites as a whole or for specific resource paths with any desired granularity
* **configurable "Content Security Policies"**<br>the server is secured using [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) with a configuration option for specific "Content Security Policies"
* **standard-compliant Logging**<br>access logging is done using [morgan](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html). Logs may be written into a file either in "standard Apache common log format" or any other format

## Installation and Use ##

You may easily install and run this server on your machine.

Just install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) according to the instructions for your platform and follow these steps:

1. either clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/) or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-within-express/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) with its contents to your disk and unpack it there 
2. open a shell and navigate to the root directory of this repository
3. run `npm install` in order to install the server

### Preparing the first Start ###

For a quick start, the server comes preconfigured for two different use cases:

* *without* virtual hosts processing<br>this variant does not require much preparation and is ideal for initial experiments
* *with* virtual hosts processing<br>this variant requires a bit of preparational work but may be used to test installations serving multiple domains

#### Variant without virtual Hosts Processing ####

#### Variant with virtual Hosts Processing ####

### First Experiments ###

## Invocation Parameters ##

The server in this repo has been implemented as a Node.js script and can be invoked as follows

```
node WebServer.js [options] <file-root> [<configuration-folder> [<log-folder>]]
```

with the following arguments:

* **`<file-root>`**<br>specifies the root folder (relative to the server's current working directory) of all deliverable static files. By default, this is a subfolder of the current working directory called `public`
* **`<configuration-folder>`**<br>specifies the folder (relative to the server's current working directory) where configuration files (such as the list of registered users) are found. By default, this is the current working directory itself
* **`<log-folder>`**<br>specifies the folder (relative to the server's current working directory) into which the log file is written. By default, this is a subfolder of the current working directory called `logs`

The following options are supported:

* **`--server-port <port>`**<br>specifies the TCP port at which to listen for incoming HTTPS requests. The default is `8443`
* **`--redirection-port <port>`**<br>if provided, this option activates HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection and specifies the TCP port at which to listen for incoming HTTP requests
* **`--proxy <proxy>`**<br>activates and configures proxy support. Consider the [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html) for a list and explanation of actually allowed values
* **`--domain <domain>`**<br>specifies the primary domain of this server. It should be the "common name" (CN) of the associated server certificate and also appears in the log file name. If virtual hosts are given as well (even if the list is empty), the primary domain is automatically added to that list
* **`--virtual-hosts <virtual-hosts>`**<br>activates virtual hosts processing and configures the domains to handle. The given argument may either be an empty string (`""`) or a string containing a comma-separated list of internet domains. All mentioned domains should also be specified as "subject alternative names" (SAN) in the server certificate
* **`--allow-subdomains`**<br>if specified, all subdomains of the given primary domain and virtual hosts are processed as well. In this case, the server certificate should also contain "subject alternative names" (SAN) with wildcards of the form `*.<domain>`
* **`--ignore-www`**<br>if specified, subdomains of the form `www.<domain>` are not treated as a separate subdomain but mapped to their main `<domain>`
* **`--cert-folder <folder>`**<br>specifies the folder where to find server certificates. By default, this is a subfolder of the server's current working directory called `certificates`
* **`--pbkdf2-iterations <count>`**<br>specifies the number of iterations when computing PBKDF2 hashes. Default is 100000
* **`--log-format <format>`**<br>specifies the format in which log entries are written into a file. Consider the [morgan documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html) for a list and explanation of permitted settings. Default is `common`

If everything works well, the server reports its start-up any logs all incoming requests on `stdout`

### Configuring Domains and Virtual Hosts ###

On a "production system", usually no special precautions need to be taken to run this server.

On a local machine, however, the following configuration steps should be taken:






## Embedded Node-RED Instance ##

The embedded Node-RED instance comes with two sets of flows for initial "smoke tests": one for a server *with* virtual host processing and one *without*.
A GET request to `/hello-world` simply responds with a "Hello, World!" message, GET, PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE requests to `show-request` dump the contents of any incoming message to the Node-RED debug window.

![initial Flow Sets](initialFlows.png)

Both flow sets are welcome to be removed and replaced with more meaningful ones.

## User Registry ##

The server comes with a file `registeredUsers.json` which contains all "registered users" of this server.
Initially, it contains a single user named "node-red" with password "t0pS3cr3t!" who is needed to access the embedded Node-RED editor.
New users may be added and existing users changed or deleted at will with a simple text editor.

`registeredUsers.json` contains the JSON serialization of a JavaScript object with the following format:

* the object's property names are the names of registered users<br>user names have no specific format, they may be user ids, email addresses or any other data you are free to choose
* the object's property values are JavaScript objects with the following properties, at least (additional properties may be added at will):
  * **Roles**<br>is either missing or contains a list of strings with the user's roles. There is no specific format for role names - just the role `node-red` has a special meaning: users with this role are allowed to access the embedded Node-RED editor
  * **Salt**<br>contains a random "salt" value which is used during PBKDF2 password hash calculation
  * **Hash**<br>contains the actual PBKDF2 hash of the user's password

The server will not start if file `registeredUsers.json` is missing or does not have valid JSON content.

Users without proper `Salt` and `Hash` values can not authenticate themselves. Those without role `node-red` can not access the embedded Node-RED editor

> Nota bene: Node-RED *flows* work independent of the embedded editor's accessability!

### Generating "Salt" and "Hash" ###

This repo also contains a small utility called `generateSaltAndHash` which may be used to generate the "Salt" and "Hash" values for entries in the user registry.

From within the folder containing the repository, it is invoked with

```
./generateSaltAndHash
```

The script will ask for a password and - as soon as the password has been entered - generate salt and hash values and display them on the console. From there, these values may be copied into the clipboard and added to `registeredUsers.json`.

By default, `generateSaltAndHash` assumes a PBKDF2 iteration count of 100000. If another count is desired, the utility should be invoked with

```
./generateSaltAndHash pbkdf2-iterations <count>
```

## CORS Support ##

"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" (CORS) instructs browsers to restrict resource access to specific domains. For this server, CORS behaviour can be specified in file `sharedResources.json` which is found in the configured `<configuration-folder>`.

This file contains the JSON serialization of a JavaScript array containing objects with the following format:

* property `PathPattern` contains a regular expression (RegExp) pattern which is compared against any incoming URL path (including the domain name, if virtual hosts are to be processed)
* property `OriginList` is either `null` (which acts as a placeholder allowing unrestricted resource sharing) or a JavaScript array containing the names (without protocols or port numbers) of all domains which are allowed to request the matching resource (whereas any domain not mentioned in this list is not allowed to access the resource)

Without any entries, browser settings apply (which are often quite restrictive)

The server will not start if file `sharedResources.json` is missing or does not have valid JSON content.

## Content Security Policies ##

Browsers constantly impose tighter security restrictions on HTML pages. If certain facilitations are needed, they can be entered in a file called `ContentSecurityPolicies.json` which is found in the configured `<configuration-folder>`.

This file contains the JSON serialization of a JavaScript object with the following format:

* the object's property names are "Content Security Policies" (CSP) "directives"<br>see [the documentation at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) for a list and explanation of available directives
* the object's property values are JavaScript arrays containing a list of policies for the given directive (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src) for a list and explanation of such policies)

The server will not start if file `ContentSecurityPolicies.json` is missing or does not have valid JSON content.

## Logging ##

The server uses [morgan](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html) for the formatting of log entries.

Two logs are written: a simplified one (which allows to monitor server operation) is written to `stdout`, an extended one into a file named after the configured primary domain (or `localhost`) within the configured `<log-folder>`.

Unless this has been changed, the larger log file follows the "standard Apache common log format" and may be processed using standard log file analysis tools. Other log format may be configured with command option `--log-format <format>`
